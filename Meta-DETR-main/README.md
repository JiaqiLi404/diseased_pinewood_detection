Paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11731v3

Update on 22nd Sept: We have made improvements to this work and achieved much better performance and efficiency! Check our the latest version of this work at https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11731v3. Codes will be released in Oct 2021.

Update on 31st Oct: Codes released. However, we are rushing an important deadline, so codes might still be a bit messy. We will release the cleaned-up codes, pre-trained models, logs, and detailed instruction in early Dec 2021.

Environment:
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
Python 3.7
Pytorch 1.7.1
Cuda 10.2
